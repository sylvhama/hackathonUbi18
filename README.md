# Hackathon Ubisoft 2018

Tiny game made during a hackathon at Ubisoft Montreal with co-workers. Our goal was:

* Show off that we can make web based games via [Phaser](https://phaser.io/);
* Demonstrate the power of web sockets via [socket.io](https://socket.io/);
* Explain the concept and the benefits of [Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/);
* More details: https://slides.com/jtrollia/deck-3/

We have used this [wonderful tutorial](https://gamedevacademy.org/create-a-basic-multiplayer-game-in-phaser-3-with-socket-io-part-1/) to quickly build a prototype.
